# Wavemaker

This is the latest build I'm working on for 2020 release

It's a work in progress at the moment and is intended to be an evergreen version I hope. Using Vue there will also be a server API I'll set up for the remote work, although the aim is that it will run standalone (hence Electron) but also synced up to the Web (as a PWA)
